    <h2 id="main">Introduction</h2>
      <p>I've always really enjoyed food more than anything. I love to cook and go out to eat and try new restaurants,
        so I thought, why not make a website devoted to all my favorite restaurants, recipes and bloggers. I was originally going to 
        make a personal website about myself, something informative I could show my potential employers, but where's the fun in that?
        If I were a potential employer I'd rather look at pictures of sushi and burgers instead of yet another mind numbing unoriginal
        portfolio website. Maybe I'll just sneak my resume in here somewhere.

    <h2>Brief Biography</h2>  
      <p> I was born and raised in Maryland, USA. Both of my parents are Bulgarian and raised me to be a rather adventure eater, 
        which is something I somewhat pride myself on. While I can't cook that many Bulgarian dishes yet it is on my bucket/ to do list. 
        I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan hoping to pursue a career in SI. As you could imagine being a broke college student 
        makes cooking fancy meals and going out to eat a lot a bit of a challenge but I make do. My dream job would be to do what Anthony Bordain did 
        and travel the world and eat great food and meet couple people while trying new things along the way. However I do refrain responding this 
        during job interviews for STEM jobs.
