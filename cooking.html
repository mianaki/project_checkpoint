      I love to cook but I hardly have the time and when I do have the time I don't have the groceries or access to a car. But here's 
        some stuff I've cooked when I did have the time and groceries. My entire instagram feed is just recipes and people cooking nestled inbetween 
        gameday posts, I like to save the recipes to try them out later and they usually turn out pretty good. I promise I'll be unstoppable once 
        I finally commit to buying an air fryer.

    <h2>Sushi</h2>
    <img src = "images/sushi.jpg" alt ="sushi I made">
    <p>This summer I finally made sushi. It's one of those things I said I would do over and over but I finally did last summer. I was 
        pleasanlty surprised by how it turned out. Kind of impressed with myself.
    </p>

    <h2>Burger and Potato Wedges</h2>
    <img src = "images/burger.jpg" alt ="a burger and potato wedges I made">
    <p>Slight caveat this was a Hello Fresh recipe I followed, which I kind of feel is cheating but it still turned out really good, my roomates can 
        vouch for that.
    </p>

    <h2>Shrimp Ceviche</h2>
    <img src = "images/ceviche.jpg" alt ="Shrimp ceviche I made">
    <p>As previosuly mentioned, I love ceviche. So of course I had to make it myself and I was really happy with how it turned out. It's become
        a staple in our household since my parents love it too.
    </p>

    <h2>Bang Bang Chicken</h2>
    <img src = "images/bangbangchicken.jpg" alt ="Orange spicy chinese style chicken">
    <p>One of my favorite food bloggers posted this recipe for a spicy asian style "bang bang chicken". While I did make an absolute mess of the 
        kitchen frying chicken it turned out SO good. This is where the air fryer would come in handy.
    </p>

    <h2>Flautas</h2>
    <img src = "images/flautas.jpg" alt ="Flautas">
    <p>Yet another Hello Fresh recipe that turned out delicious. My roomate's mom got us a couple weeks of hello fresh recipes so we were eating
        really good for a month. 
    </p>

    <h2>Poke Bowls</h2>
    <img src = "images/poke.jpg" alt ="Make your own poke bowl station">
    <p>I made spicy salmon and tuna poke and set up a little make your own poke bowl for my family. It turned out yummy and nobody got food poisoning 
        despite their mild concerns. I had a little too much fun shopping at H mart for the ingredients for these.
    </p>
        
     <h2>Avocado Caprese Salad</h2>
     <img src = "images/caprese.jpg" alt ="avocado caprese salad">
     <p>This was super simple to make but so good. Definitely one of my go to lazy yet fairly healthy lunch options.
     </p>
     
    <h2>Quinoa Bowl</h2>
    <img src = "images/quinoa.jpg" alt ="Quinoa bowl with avocado">
    <p>In an attempt to make up for eating terribly after finals week, I made this quinoa bowl with pretty much every colorful vegetable I could find
        in the fridge. Not pictured: the chipotle dressing I made to go with it.
    </p>

    <h2>Chicken and Couscous</h2>
    <img src = "images/chicken.jpg" alt ="Chicken and Couscous">
    <p>Yet another Hello Fresh recipe that I really enjoyed. Couscous is one of those things I never even considered buying at the grocery store 
        but I really enjoyed it in this recipe and have bought it since. I think that's honestly the best part of Hello Fresh.
    </p>
        
    <h2>Vermicelli With Shrimp</h2>
    <img src = "images/vermicelli.jpg" alt ="Vermicelli With Shrimp">
    <p>This is a shrimp vermicelli bowl I made when I was out of groceries and only had frozen shrimp and vermicelli noodles in my pantry 
        It turned into a pretty solid meal.
