        This page is dedicated to some of my favorite restaurants. This is by no means a complete list but it's a start. The majority of
          these restaurants are located in the DC, Maryland, Virginia area. Perhaps in the future I'll expand to Ann Arbor restaurants 
          too! Who knows?
      </p>

      <h2>1. Fish Taco</h2>
      <img src = "images/fishtaco2.jpg" alt ="tacos from fish taco">
      <p>Coming in at number one is my all time favorite and go to restaurant Fish Taco. Not only is it delicious, 
        its also pretty healthy and fast. The decor is also nice and they play fun music</p>

      <h2>2. Raku</h2>
      <img src = "images/raku2.jpg" alt ="sushi from Raku">
      <p>Coming in at number two is my go to sushi place to go to for dinner. The sushi is good and their outdoor seating is a nice 
        place to relax and do some people watching while enjoying your meal.
      </p>

    <h2>3. King Street Oyster Bar</h2>
    <img src = "images/kingstreet2.jpg" alt ="Oysters from King Street Oyster Bar">
    <p>Coming in at number three is my newest go to happy hour spot. While I am not of age, my mom enjoys the cocktails 
        while I enjoy the $1 oysters, calamari and tuna tartar tacos.</p>

    <h2>4. Mon Ami Gabi</h2>
    <img src = "images/monami2.jpg" alt ="steak frites from Mon Ami Gabi">
    <p>Mon Ami Gabi is definitely one of my go to brunch spots. While I typically order the steak frites with the herb butter 
        sometimes I like to switch it up and get their croque madame. Their desserts are also really good.
    </p>

      <h2>5. Sprig &amp; Sprout</h2>
      <img src = "images/sprigsprout2.jpg" alt ="assortment of vietnamese dishes">
      <p>Sprig and Sprout might be one of the most underrated restaurants in the area. It is a small hole in the wall in Glover park. 
        This is my go to Vietnamese restaurant. I think I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and I am yet to be dissapointed.
    </p>

      <h2>6. Maki Maki</h2>
      <img src = "images/makimaki.jpg" alt ="Sushi from Maki Maki">
      <p>Maki Maki is my go to place for takeout Sushi. Their sushi is great and super fresh and their other entrees come in huge portions. </p>

     <h2>7. Pisco y Nazca</h2>
     <img src = "images/pisco2.jpg" alt ="assortment of Peruvian food">
     <p>Ceviche might be my all time favorite food, which is why Pisco y Nazca deserves a spot on this list. They have the best ceviche I have 
         had in the US. Their lomo saltado is also really good.
     </p>
     
      <h2>8. Iron Age</h2>
      <img src = "images/ironage2.jpg" alt ="Korean barbeque from Iron Age">
      <p>Korean Barbeque is always a good time. Iron Age all you can eat Korean BBQ is delicious. The only downside is they do not take reservations 
        and there is always a wait, but I promise it is worth it.
      </p>

    <h2>9. Poki DC</h2>
    <img src = "images/poki2.jpg" alt ="a poke bowl from poki DC">
    <p>Poke is another one of my favorite foods and this is definitely my go to Poke place at home. It's like sushi you can customize exactly to your 
        liking, definitely worth the drive.
    </p>
  

    <h2>10. Shake Shack</h2>
    <img src = "images/shakeshack2.jpg" alt ="burgers from shakeshack">
    <p>And last, but not least I had to include Shake shack. Sometimes your just really craving a good greasy burger and shake shack just hits the spot.</p>
